# JavaScript Objects Swap Function & Number Count Function

* Write a function named `swap` that switches all the properties and values in an object. For example, `swap({"a": "b", c: "d"})` //=> {"b": "a", d: "c"}. Assume that all input objects have no nesting.

* Write a function that returns an object where each key is a character in a given string and each value is the number of times that character occurs in the string. For example, `charNums('aab')` will return {"a": 2, "b": 1}. This functions takes a string type and returns an object.
