#### addOne

Given an array of single digit numbers, write a function to add 1 to the number that is made up by each array.

eg. [5,0,0] is 500 -> 500 + 1 = 501 -> [5,0,1].
eg. [9] is 9 -> 9 + 1 = 10 -> [1,0].

Each element in the final array must be a one digit number (addOne([9]) != [10])


#### Sample Code
```js
addOne([1,0]) = [1,1]
addOne([5,5,5]) = [5,5,6]
addOne([9,9]) = [1,0,0]
addOne([1,2,6,4]) = [1,2,6,5]
addOne([4,9,9]) = [5,0,0]
```
